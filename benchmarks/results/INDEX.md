## Visualization Files

All visualizations are high-resolution PNG files (300 DPI).

### 8. summary_metrics.png (276 KB)
**Purpose:** Overall comparison across all methods

**Layout:** 2x2 grid
- Top-left: Marginal fidelity (KS statistic)
- Top-right: Correlation error
- Bottom-left: Zero-fraction error
- Bottom-right: Training time

**Key takeaway:** microplex wins on 3/4 metrics (all quality metrics)

### 9. distributions_micro.png (234 KB)
**Purpose:** microplex distribution comparison

**Layout:** 2x2 grid (income, assets, debt, savings)
- Blue = real data
- Red = synthetic data
- KS statistic annotated

**Key takeaway:** Excellent distribution matching (low KS)

### 10. distributions_ctgan.png (292 KB)
**Purpose:** CT-GAN distribution comparison

**Key takeaway:** Poorer distribution matching, struggles with zero-inflation

### 11. distributions_tvae.png (305 KB)
**Purpose:** TVAE distribution comparison

**Key takeaway:** Moderate quality, better than CT-GAN but worse than microplex

### 12. distributions_copula.png (237 KB)
**Purpose:** Gaussian Copula distribution comparison

**Key takeaway:** Worst distribution matching, severe zero-inflation problems

### 13. zero_inflation.png (109 KB)
**Purpose:** Zero-fraction preservation analysis

**Layout:** 2 panels
- Left: Zero-fractions by method vs real data (bar chart)
- Right: Absolute errors (bar chart)

**Key takeaway:** microplex achieves 2-22% error vs 5-22% for others
**This is the key differentiator** - demonstrates two-stage modeling advantage

### 14. timing.png (106 KB)
**Purpose:** Performance comparison

**Layout:** 2 panels
- Left: Training time comparison
- Right: Generation time comparison

**Key takeaway:** microplex has near-instant generation (< 0.1s)

## Usage Guide

### For Quick Overview
1. Read `README.md` (5 min)
2. Look at `summary_metrics.png`
3. Look at `zero_inflation.png` (key differentiator)

### For Technical Details
1. Read `BENCHMARK_REPORT.md` (20 min)
2. Review all visualization files
3. Check `ISSUES_FOUND.md` for improvement opportunities

### For Reproduction
1. Review `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`
2. Run `python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`
3. Compare your results to `results.csv`

### For Development
1. Read `ISSUES_FOUND.md`
2. Check "Opportunities for Improvement" section
3. Prioritize based on recommendations

## Key Results At-a-Glance

From `results.csv`:

```
Method,Mean KS,Corr Error,Zero Error,Train Time (s),Gen Time (s)
micro,0.0611,0.1060,0.0223,6.1,0.0
ctgan,0.1997,0.3826,0.0986,35.5,0.8
tvae,0.2459,0.1969,0.0555,12.0,0.6
copula,0.2632,0.1756,0.2241,0.5,0.8
```

**Interpretation:**
- microplex wins on Mean KS (3.3x better)
- microplex wins on Corr Error (1.7x better)
- microplex wins on Zero Error (2.5x better)
- microplex wins on Gen Time (6x faster)
- Copula wins on Train Time (but worst quality)
