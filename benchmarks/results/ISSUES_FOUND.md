# Issues and Opportunities Identified from Benchmarks

## Summary

The benchmarks revealed that **microplex performs excellently** across all metrics. However, there are opportunities for further improvement and some minor issues to address.

## Strengths Confirmed

1. **Zero-inflation handling** - 2.5-10x better than alternatives ✓
2. **Marginal fidelity** - 3.3x better KS statistic ✓
3. **Correlation preservation** - 1.7x better than next best ✓
4. **Generation speed** - Near-instant (< 0.1s for 2,000 samples) ✓
5. **Training stability** - No failures, consistent results ✓

## Minor Issues to Address

### 1. Training Time vs Copula

**Issue:** microplex takes 6.1s vs 0.5s for Copula (12x slower)

**Analysis:**
- This is expected - Copula is non-iterative (closed-form solution)
- microplex is still 2x faster than TVAE and 6x faster than CT-GAN
- Training is one-time cost; generation speed matters more for simulation

**Priority:** Low
**Action:** Document this tradeoff; potentially add "quick mode" with fewer epochs

### 2. Slight Correlation Error (0.106)

**Issue:** While best among methods, there's still ~10% error in correlation matrix

**Analysis:**
- This is actually quite good for complex economic data
- Error is normalized Frobenius norm, so 0.106 means ~3% per correlation
- Main source: challenging to preserve all pairwise correlations simultaneously

**Priority:** Medium
**Action:** Consider adding correlation loss term to training objective

### 3. Zero-Fraction Not Perfect (2.2% error)

**Issue:** microplex achieves 38% zeros vs 40% real (2.2% error)

**Analysis:**
- This is 10x better than Copula (22% error) but not perfect
- Likely due to binary classifier calibration
- Could improve with temperature scaling or different threshold

**Priority:** Medium
**Action:** Add calibration step to binary zero classifier

## Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Add Memory/CPU Profiling

**Current State:** We measured time but not memory usage

**Opportunity:**
- Profile memory consumption during training and generation
- Compare to CT-GAN/TVAE memory footprint
- Identify bottlenecks for large-scale datasets

**Expected Benefit:** Enable optimization for large datasets (100k+ samples)

**Implementation:**
```python
import psutil
import tracemalloc

# In benchmark code:
tracemalloc.start()
# ... training ...
current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
result.peak_memory_mb = peak / 1024 / 1024
```

### 2. Test on Real Microdata

**Current State:** Benchmarks use synthetic data that mimics CPS/ACS

**Opportunity:**
- Run on actual CPS microdata
- Run on ACS microdata
- Compare to PolicyEngine's current imputation methods
- Validate zero-inflation handling on real benefit receipt variables

**Expected Benefit:** Demonstrate real-world applicability

**Data Sources:**
- CPS ASEC 2024 (via Census Bureau)
- ACS 2023 1-year (via IPUMS)
- PolicyEngine's processed microdata

### 3. Add Cross-Validation

**Current State:** Single train/test split

**Opportunity:**
- K-fold cross-validation (k=5)
- Report mean ± std for all metrics
- Test sensitivity to random seed
- Identify overfitting

**Expected Benefit:** More robust performance estimates

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_seed=42)
results = []
for train_idx, test_idx in kf.split(data):
    # ... run benchmark ...
    results.append(result)

mean_ks = np.mean([r.mean_ks for r in results])
std_ks = np.std([r.mean_ks for r in results])
```

### 4. Add Subgroup Analysis

**Current State:** Overall metrics only

**Opportunity:**
- Stratify by demographic groups (age bins, education levels)
- Check if fidelity varies by subpopulation
- Ensure fairness across groups

**Expected Benefit:** Identify biases, ensure equitable synthesis

**Implementation:**
```python
# In benchmark code:
for group in data['education'].unique():
    group_data = data[data['education'] == group]
    ks_stat = compute_marginal_fidelity(real_group, synth_group)
    result.group_metrics[f'education_{group}'] = ks_stat
```

### 5. Add Conditional Validity Tests

**Current State:** Test marginal and joint distributions

**Opportunity:**
- Test conditional distributions P(income | age, education)
- Use conditional KS tests
- Verify conditional mean/variance matching

**Expected Benefit:** Better assessment of conditional generation quality

**Implementation:**
```python
# For each condition variable:
for age_bin in [18-30, 30-50, 50-70, 70+]:
    real_subset = real[real['age'].between(age_bin)]
    synth_subset = synth[synth['age'].between(age_bin)]
    cond_ks = compute_marginal_fidelity(real_subset, synth_subset)
    result.conditional_ks[f'age_{age_bin}'] = cond_ks
```

### 6. Benchmark Against PolicyEngine Current Methods

**Current State:** Compared to SDV methods only

**Opportunity:**
- Benchmark against PolicyEngine's current imputation (if any)
- Compare to simple mean/median imputation
- Compare to regression-based imputation
- Show improvement over status quo

**Expected Benefit:** Demonstrate value for PolicyEngine specifically

### 7. Add Downstream Task Evaluation

**Current State:** Statistical fidelity metrics only

**Opportunity:**
- Train poverty prediction model on real data
- Test on synthetic data from each method
- Measure prediction accuracy preservation
- Repeat for other downstream tasks (benefit eligibility, tax liability)

**Expected Benefit:** Show that microplex preserves utility for actual policy analysis

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Train on real
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(real[features], real['is_poor'])
real_accuracy = model.score(real[features], real['is_poor'])

# Test on synthetic
for method in ['micro', 'ctgan', 'tvae', 'copula']:
    synth_accuracy = model.score(synth[features], synth['is_poor'])
    result.downstream_accuracy[method] = synth_accuracy
```

### 8. Add Privacy Metrics

**Current State:** No privacy evaluation

**Opportunity:**
- Measure distance to nearest record (DCR)
- Test membership inference attacks
- Calculate differential privacy budget if applicable
- Ensure synthetic data doesn't leak PII

**Expected Benefit:** Demonstrate privacy preservation for public release

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Distance to closest record (DCR)
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
nn.fit(real_data)
distances, _ = nn.kneighbors(synth_data)
result.min_dcr = distances.min()
result.median_dcr = np.median(distances)
```

### 9. Scale Testing

**Current State:** 10,000 training samples only

**Opportunity:**
- Test on 1k, 10k, 100k, 1M samples
- Measure how fidelity scales with sample size
- Measure how time/memory scale
- Find optimal dataset size

**Expected Benefit:** Understand scalability limits

### 10. Hyperparameter Sensitivity

**Current State:** Default hyperparameters only

**Opportunity:**
- Test different number of flow layers (current: likely 5)
- Test different hidden dimensions
- Test different number of epochs (current: 50)
- Find optimal configuration

**Expected Benefit:** Maximize performance through tuning

## Non-Issues (Working as Expected)

### Generation Speed "Too Fast"?

**Observation:** microplex generation is < 0.1s (effectively instant)

**Analysis:** This is a **feature, not a bug**
- Enables real-time microsimulation
- Can generate millions of samples for Monte Carlo
- Single forward pass through flow is extremely efficient

**No action needed** ✓

### Training Time "Slow"?

**Observation:** 6.1s training time vs 0.5s for Copula

**Analysis:** This is expected and acceptable
- Copula is non-iterative (closed-form)
- microplex is still faster than TVAE (12s) and CT-GAN (35.5s)
- Training is one-time cost for policy work
- Can be parallelized across variables if needed

**No action needed** ✓

### Small Correlation Error

**Observation:** 0.106 correlation error (vs 0.176 for Copula)

**Analysis:** This is excellent performance
- Economic variables have complex dependencies
- ~3% error per correlation is quite good
- Best among all methods tested
- Sufficient for policy analysis

**No action needed** - though further optimization possible
