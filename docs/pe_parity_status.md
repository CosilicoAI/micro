### Known Gaps (CPS Data Limitations)

| Target | Error | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| capital_gains | 96% | CPS has limited capital gains data |
| social_security | 35% | Underreported in CPS |
| employment_income | 21% | Underreported in CPS |
| dividend_income | 73% | Underreported in CPS |

These require income imputation (like PE's enhanced CPS) to fix.

## Target Categories

### ✅ Microplex Has (PE Doesn't)

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Geographic (CD) | 436 | Population by Congressional District |
| Geographic (SLDU) | ~1,950 | Population by State Legislative District (Upper) |
| Age Distribution | 918 | Population by age band by state |
| AGI Distribution | 393 | Tax returns by filing status × AGI bracket |

### ✅ Both Have

| Category | Microplex | PE | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----|----|
| SNAP participation | ✓ | ✓ | National aggregate |
| SSI participation | ✓ | ✓ | National aggregate |
| Total population | ✓ | ✓ | 372M |
| State population | ✓ | ✓ | Via age distribution |

### ❌ PE Has (Microplex Needs)

| Category | Count | Notes | Priority |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| **IRS SOI Income Totals** | 17 | Employment, dividends, capital gains, etc. | HIGH |
| **CBO Aggregates** | 6 | SNAP $, SSI $, SS $, payroll/income tax | HIGH |
| **EITC Outlays** | 1 | $72.7B | HIGH |
| **Medicaid by State** | 713 | Enrollment + spending by eligibility | MEDIUM |
| **CHIP by State** | 765 | Enrollment + spending | MEDIUM |
| **ACA by State** | 102 | Marketplace enrollment + spending | MEDIUM |
| **Census Pop by State** | 52 | Simple state totals | LOW (have via age) |

## Priority Targets to Add

### Phase 1: Income Distribution (17 targets)

These require income columns in CPS microdata:

| Target | Value | CPS Column | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| employment_income | $9,022B | WSAL_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| self_employment_income | $436B | SEMP_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| taxable_pension_income | $828B | RET_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| social_security | $774B | SS_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| tax_exempt_pension_income | $580B | RET_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| long_term_capital_gains | $1,137B | - | 🔴 Imputation needed |
| partnership_s_corp_income | $976B | - | 🔴 Imputation needed |
| qualified_dividend_income | $260B | DIV_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| unemployment_compensation | $208B | UC_VAL | 🟡 Need column |
| taxable_interest_income | $127B | INT_VAL | 🟡 Need column |

### Phase 2: Benefit Program Spending (6 targets)

| Target | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| snap | $103B | SNAP total benefits |
| social_security | $2,624B | Old-age, survivors, disability |
| ssi | $78B | Supplemental Security Income |
| eitc | $73B | Earned Income Tax Credit |
| unemployment_compensation | $59B | UI benefits |

### Phase 3: State-Level Benefits (1,631 targets)

| Category | States | Targets |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Medicaid enrollment | 51 | 255 |
| Medicaid spending | 51 | 254 |
| CHIP enrollment | 51 | 153 |
| CHIP spending | 51 | 612 |
| ACA enrollment | 51 | 51 |
| ACA spending | 51 | 51 |
| Census population | 51 | 51 |

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Expand CPS Microdata
Load full CPS ASEC with income detail columns.

### Step 2: Add Income Targets
Create calibration targets for IRS SOI income totals.

### Step 3: Add Benefit Spending Targets
Add CBO/Treasury aggregate spending targets.

### Step 4: State-Level Benefits
Add Medicaid, CHIP, ACA enrollment by state.

### Step 5: Capital Gains Imputation
Model capital gains distribution (not directly in CPS).

## Current Calibration

With current targets, microplex calibrates to:
- **436 CD populations** (0% error with 500K sample)
- **~1,950 SLDU populations** (0% error with 500K sample)
- **918 age distributions** (8% error with 100K sample)

Missing PolicyEngine parity:
- Income totals by source (17)
- Benefit spending aggregates (6)
- State-level benefit enrollment (1,631)
